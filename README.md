# Pure HTML, CSS Portfolio
I decided to take courses from scratch to because it felt like I wasn't good enough with html and css after giving a break for like 1 and a half year. So here is a portfolio website that i created with pure html, css, js. Its a pretty basic design that i saw in figma. Here is a link https://www.figma.com/file/pjQ459fWWaSOtXWkY3lrOq?type=design&is-community-duplicate=1&fuid=. I didn't fully create the website im too lazy for that.
